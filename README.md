Hi,👋🏻✨

My name is Favour. I am a data analyst who spend her days wielding a powerful toolkit - SQL, Excel, Cognos, Power Bl, Tableau, and Python - to craft compelling stories and insights from complex data. But what really energizes me is the opportunity to share these stories with a dynamic community of data enthusiasts, collaborating, learning, and growing together.
- 📚 I'm presently focused on advancing my data analytics capabilities in SQL, Excel, Cognos, R, Power BI, Tableau, and Python.
- 😝 I'm a curious tech enthusiast, always hovering around the latest advancements and learning opportunities.
- ✨ Fun fact, When I'm not geeking out over tech, you can find me gaming!
